This script defines three encoder classes that inherit from the LightweightEncoder class.
These encoders are used to process and transform OWL (Web Ontology Language) items into a format suitable for downstream tasks.
Each encoder is specialized for different types of OWL items: Concept, Concept with Children, and Concept with Parent.

Classes:
    - ConceptLightweightEncoder: Encodes OWL items representing concepts.
    - ConceptChildrenLightweightEncoder: Encodes OWL items representing concepts and their children.
    - ConceptParentLightweightEncoder: Encodes OWL items representing concepts and their parents.
