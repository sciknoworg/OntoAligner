Parsers
====================

Generic Ontology Alignment Track
-----------------------------------------
The generic OA aims to provide a manual parsing of desired ontologies as a source and target to do the alignment.

Graph Triple Ontology Alignment Track
-----------------------------------------
The graph triplet parser that aims to provide triplet representations of ontologies for KGEs.

OAEI: Anatomy Track
---------------
The anatomy real world case is about matching the Adult Mouse Anatomy (2744 classes) and the NCI Thesaurus (3304 classes) describing the human anatomy.

OAEI: Biodiversity and Ecology Track
---------------------------------
The goal of the track is to find pairwise alignments between ontologies and thesauri that are particularly useful for biodiversity and ecology research and are being used in various projects. They have been developed in parallel and are very overlapping. They are semantically rich and contain tens of thousands of classes.

OAEI: Bio-ML Track
---------------
The Bio-ML track is a Machine Learning (ML) friendly Biomedical track for Equivalence and Subsumption Matching. This track presents an unified evaluation framework suitable for both ML-based and non-ML-based OM systems. The datasets of this track are based on Mondo and UMLS Metathesarus. This track supersedes the previous largebio and phenotype tracks.

OAEI: Common Knowledge Graphs Track
---------------------------------
This track composes of a task aimed at matching the schema of two common and highly influential knowledge graphs which are : DBpedia and the Never Ending Language Learner (NELL).

OAEI: Food Nutritional Composition Track
---------------------------------------
This track consists of finding alignments between food concepts from CIQUAL, the French food nutritional composition database, and food concepts from SIREN. Food concepts from both databases are described in LanguaL, a well-known multilingual thesaurus using faceted classification.

OAEI: Material Sciences and Engineering Track
------------------------------------------
The Material Sciences and Engineering (MSE) track contains the first benchmark for the evaluation of (semi-)automatic ontology matching techniques. In this emerging ontological domain, small to mid-sized upper and domain level ontologies are used that contain concepts described in natural language and are implemented by heterogeneous design principles with only partial overlap to each other.

OAEI: Disease and Phenotype Track
---------------------------------
The Pistoia Alliance Ontologies Mapping project team organises and sponsors this track based on a real use case where it is required to find alignments between disease and phenotype ontologies. Specifically, the selected ontologies are the Human Phenotype (HP) Ontology, the Mammalian Phenotype (MP) Ontology, the Human Disease Ontology (DOID), and the Orphanet and Rare Diseases Ontology (ORDO).
