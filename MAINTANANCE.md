| Case-Study | The [LLMs4Subjects shared task](https://sites.google.com/view/llms4subjects/) challenges researchers to develop LLM-based methods for automated subject indexing of [TIB’s technical records in multiple languages](https://www.tib.eu/en/). Using the [GND](https://www.dnb.de/EN/Professionell/Standardisierung/GND/gnd_node.html), this task enhances cataloging and semantic linking of topics, people, and works. OntoAligner can contribute by aligning ontologies, improving indexing accuracy, and enhancing interoperability across datasets. This integration ensures consistent, multilingual classification and supports more efficient automated subject tagging. In the end, the resulting case-study will be used to add a tutorial on https://ontoaligner.readthedocs.org/. |                          Ongoing                          |

| Aligner    | [LogMap](https://github.com/ernestojimenezruiz/logmap-matcher) is a well-known ontology alignment framework. Integrating it as a supported aligner would add significant value to OntoAligner. Since LogMap is released under the Apache-2.0 license, which is compatible with OntoAligner’s license, its inclusion would be seamless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                          Ongoing                          |
| Aligner    | [OWL2Vec4OA](https://github.com/Sevinjt/OWL2Vec4OA) is an extension of an ontology embedding system [OWL2Vec*](https://github.com/KRR-Oxford/OWL2Vec-Star/), which incorporate confidence values in the graph edges represented by (uncertain) available mappings between the network of ontologies. It is released this year and defeats the OWL2Vec* model. It would be great to have it in OntoAligner and since it is under Apache-2.0 license it would make it as a valuable module for Aligners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | To-Do (contacted they are happy to help with integration) |
| Tests      | Implementing diverse unit tests to improve the maintainability of OntoAligner. The tests will cover core functionalities, including ontology parsing and alignment strategies. Until now, our focus has been on refining core features and ensuring alignment accuracy. Additionally, the evolving nature of the library made it challenging to establish stable test cases. With the current maturity of the project, adding unit tests is now one of the priorities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                           To-Do                           |
| Aligner    | The work of [Ontology Matching with Large Language Models and Prioritized Depth-First Search]() uses Prioritized Dept-First Search that results in a high matching efficiency in terms of querying the LLMs and time. Especially it outperforms state-of-the-art models in Biomedical datasets such as Bio-ML tracks. Adding this model as one of the Aligners is ideal in terms of efficiency for various engaging comunities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |  To-Do (contacted and waiting for authors code release)   |

It is mostly tested on the Bio-ML track, so we might consider this aligner in the OntoAligner as it is license is compatible with ours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                           To-Do                           |
| Aligner    | [OLaLa](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03837) is a RAG based aligner model in Java, and it uses a different approach than we implemented some components can also be used in combination with existing approaches so it would be great if we translate the code from Java to python and have it as another aligner with the capability of allowing users to choose their own LLM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                           To-Do                           |

## 3. Maintenance Regulations
The following activities will be performed regularly:
- **Code Quality**:
  - Enforce PEP 8 compliance and code consistency using `pre-commit` hooks with `ruff` for linting and formatting.
  - Run pre-commit checks regularly to maintain code quality and prevent style violations before commits.
  - Perform continuous code refactoring to improve readability and reduce technical debt.
- **Version Control**:
  - During the development or contribution we obligated to use Git with clear commit messages following best practices.
  - We follow semantic versioning for the releases (e.g., v1.0.0 for the first stable release).
  - OntoAligner Utilize GitHub **CI/CD** for automated ReadTheDocs deployment on every push to the main branch.
  - Moreover, the PyPI release is automated for each versioning tag ensuring easy distribution.
  - Each release includes (and should contain) proper documentation and a detailed in the **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)** for new features, bug fixes, and breaking changes.
- **Release Cycle**:
  - **Major Releases**: Major feature updates or breaking changes will be released every 6 months. These releases will introduce new features, remove deprecated functionality, or make significant changes to the architecture.
  - **Minor Releases**: Regular updates that add new features or improvements will be released every month.
  - **Patch Releases**: Bug fixes, security patches, and minor adjustments will be released as necessary, with a goal of addressing critical issues within 2-3 weeks of identification.
- **Documentation**
  - Each new Aligner model should include a "Tutorial" guide for users to quickly use that model within the OntoAligner on real-world datasets.
  - User documentation aim is to provide detailed information for each class and method for users to easily understand and apply.
  - Code-level documentation is a "must" for the project as we use `Sphinx` to generate API documentation from docstrings.
- **Compatibility Checks**:
  - Regularly monitoring and updating dependencies (e.g., `rdflib`, `owlready2`, `transformers`) to ensure compatibility with the latest Python versions and security patches.
  - Regularly test compatibility with Python 3.10 and newer versions (e.g., Python 3.11, 3.12).
- **Security Management**:
  - The sensitive data such as API keys or passwords are not allowed to be hard-coded in the repository. But allowed to use feed as an argument while using specific models.
  - Each merge request will be assigned for code reviews focusing on security, especially when handling user data or integrating with external services.


## 4. Community Engagement
- We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sciknoworg/ontoaligner/issues) to track bugs, feature requests, and enhancements, ensuring critical issues get a response within **48 hours**.
- Contribution guidelines are outlined in **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**, detailing what contributions can be made, code standards, and PR submission processes.

- OntoAligner Code of Conduct is available at **[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)** to foster a welcoming and inclusive environment for community engagement.
